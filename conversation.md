## How the BRS was created (Complete)

1. All text from summary of points discussed PDF was copied and pasted into a message, asking the agent to create the BRS based on the notes
2. The agent was asked to create a BRS based on the notes provided
    2.1. I have made a mistake over here, the formatting (Headings, subheadings, etc.) was included in the message, just plain text was copied and pasted
    2.2. I recognised the message, and directly converted the PDF into markdown text
3. To fix the misunderstanding (The agent previously only thought Stock and Sales module was the entire document and main screen), I provided the agent with the entire document in markdown format, making sure to include clearly formatted headings and subheadings
4. The agent correctly updated the document
5. I exported it as a PDF 

## How the BRS Agent works

In a nutshell, it is somewhat similar to how various agents work. The agent is equipped with a set of functions it can use:
- Create File
- Initialise File
- Implement Edits (Combination of several functions)
It uses different OpenAI models depending on task complexity and purpose. Please see the Agent section on how it
